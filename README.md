# Cryptography Explorer

The Cryptography Explorer program was developed for the investigation of cryptography and cryptanalysis. It was developed as a teaching tool to try to remove the tedious calculations but still require the user to make the decisions for the processes and analysis. This is a Java application, so if the Java JRE is not installed on your computer download and install the current version of the Java JRE (Version 8 or later).

The software is being distributed as an executable jar file.  In most cases you can simply download the CryptographyExplorer.jar file (raw file), from the version directory and double-click it from your system's file browser.  You can also run it from the command-line with 

`java -jar CryptographyExplorer.jar`

The software was created using the older Java Swing API, so the appearance is a little retro. This software has been tested on Windows 10 and 11, Linux Mint 21, and MacOS Mojave.
