# Cryptography Explorer

The Cryptography Explorer program was developed for the investigation of cryptography and cryptanalysis. It was developed as a teaching tool to try to remove the tedious calculations but still require the user to make the decisions for the processes and analysis. This is a Java application, so if the Java JRE is not installed on your computer download and install the current version of the Java JRE (Version 8 or later).
